#summary Why the user is forced to enter the camera credentials in the plugin, and why MediaPortal may ask for those credentials when the user is requesting to show live video from a camera.

= Camera Credentials =

When adding a camera to the plugin, the user is requested to specify the camera credentials. There are three reasons for that:

 * The user will get an early verification that entered credentials are valid
 * The plugin can determine the camera capabilities by requesting camera parameters only camera administrators have access to
 * The credentials are remembered by the plugin, and when the user is requesting a live video stream from a camera inside MediaPortal, the saved credentials are used, thus not forcing the user to specify credentials inside MediaPortal

The third reason implies that if a user is requested to specify the credentials inside MediaPortal, the credentials on the camera have changed. Edit the camera and enter the new credentials.
